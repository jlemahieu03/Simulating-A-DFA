# Simulating a DFA
This was a Homework Assignment for CS 2250 - Computability and complexity. In a jupiter notebook we were instructed to simulate a DFA as the content corresponded and reinforce our learning of the concept in class.
It was very interesting to see how a mathematical concept we purely thought of as an abstraction could be applied to something we are more familiar with like code. Moving forward in this class it helps materalize and solidify
the concepts that we are learning in this otherwise proof-based class.
